## 🔥 What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is an **open-source movement** to create a **decentralized, censorship-resistant Library of Alexandria 2.0** — a universal archive of human knowledge that **no one can erase, censor, or control**.

We believe:  
> Knowledge is not theirs to own.  
> Knowledge is not a privilege.  
> Knowledge is the birthright of humanity.  

---

## 🔍 The Problem
Today’s knowledge is filtered, paywalled, and manipulated:  
- Corporations profit from **closed datasets and black-box AI**.  
- Governments and institutions decide what information is “safe.”  
- Historical records and valuable research are **erased or rewritten**.  
- The average citizen is kept defenseless against **hackers, surveillance, and exploitation**.  

This is not safety. This is **control**.  
Prometheus exists to end that control.

---

## 🌍 The Vision
Prometheus is a movement, not a product:  
- A **permanent, distributed archive** of humanity’s knowledge.  
- Powered by **open-source AI librarians** to retrieve, explain, and cite truth.  
- **Decentralized infrastructure** so no single entity can erase it.  
- **Privacy-first tools** to empower, not exploit.  
- A global community of developers, educators, archivists, and citizens.  

Prometheus is not built to destabilize.  
It is built to **preserve, empower, and enlighten**.

---

## 🔓 Why Dangerous Knowledge Matters
Dangerous information already circulates among those who exploit power.  
Prometheus believes that **knowledge is the best defense**.  

- Hackers, governments, and corporations know how to attack you.  
- Criminals pass down methods **generation to generation**.  
- Victims are told to stay ignorant while they are robbed of privacy, wealth, and freedom.  

We will not hide empowering knowledge “for your own safety.”  
Instead, we will **teach, contextualize, and arm citizens with truth** so that no one is prey.  

---

## 📜 Core Principles
1. **No Gates.** No one decides what you’re “allowed” to know.  
2. **No Masters.** The project is open-source, forkable, and community-owned.  
3. **No Lies.** Transparency is absolute: provenance, citations, and context included.  
4. **No Exploitation.** No surveillance. No commodification of curiosity.  
5. **Truth With Responsibility.** Dangerous knowledge is shared with context, not censorship.  
6. **Forever.** Knowledge is mirrored and decentralized so it can never be erased.  

---

## 🗣️ The Call
Prometheus is **not a company**. It is a **global uprising of light**.  
We call on:  
- **Developers**: Build transparent, open AI and infrastructure.  
- **Archivists**: Rescue lost data, documents, and history.  
- **Hackers & Researchers**: Help secure and empower the public.  
- **Educators & Philosophers**: Guide humanity’s growth with wisdom.  
- **Citizens**: Take control of your birthright — knowledge.
